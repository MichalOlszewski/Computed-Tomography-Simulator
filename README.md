# Computed-Tomography-Simulator
> TalkTalk is a application which allows recreated image from emitters and detectors. To implementation we used a radon transform.

## General info
We use a conical model to  create a singoram from input image. If we have sinogram we can recreated original image using inverse Radon transform. 
To get a better picture we used a filter that reduced a noise.
